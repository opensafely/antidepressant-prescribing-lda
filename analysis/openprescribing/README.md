## Scripts and resulting files for the sensitivity analysis with OpenPrescribing

The csv files contained in this directory were obtained from openprescribing.org (publicly available anonymised data), and do not contain any information from OpenSAFELY-TPP. `build_op_string` was done per drug class (otherwise the url query was too long), and then combined into a single measures-file-like format with `combine.py`.
